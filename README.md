#### Hi 👋 I'm Bella!

- 🤓 I am currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science at New York University through the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/). I completed my BA in [Data Science](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/academics/data-science-undergraduate-studies/data-science-major) with an emphasis in Cognition and a minor in [Public Policy](https://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/public-policy/) at the University of California, Berkeley.
- ⚡️ My coursework & research (currently in NLP-driven privacy policy analysis and privacy control mechansims for LLMs) have shown me the transformative potential of data across disciplines to bolster our communities. I am particularly interested in the responsible AI field, or any data science/ML work pertaining to public interest.
- ☁️ Outside of school, I love to run (recently ran the Central Park Half Marathon!) & bake/pretend my apartment is a café (my mango matcha is highly endorsed -- by my mom). I love to read too; currently going through "Empire of Pain" by Patrick Radden Keefe.

#### 📫 Please feel free to email me at ic2664@nyu.edu with any questions. Hope you have a lovely day!
