#### Hi 👋 I'm Bella!

- 🤓 I am currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science at New York University through the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/). I completed my BA in [Data Science](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/academics/data-science-undergraduate-studies/data-science-major) with an emphasis in Cognition and a minor in [Public Policy](https://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/public-policy/) at the University of California, Berkeley.
- ⚡️ My coursework & research (currently in algorithmic fairness and education) has shown me the transformative potential of data across disciplines to bolster people and communities, which is what drives my career aspirations. I am particularly interested in the responsible AI data science field, or any data science/ML work pertaining to public interest.
- ☁️ Outside of school, I love to run (recently ran the San Francisco Golden Gate Half Marathon)! & bake (my best creation has been a homemade raspberry soufflé). I love to read too; currently going through "Empire of Pain" by Patrick Radden Keefe.

#### 📫 Please feel free to email me at ic2664@nyu.edu with any questions. Hope you have a lovely day!
