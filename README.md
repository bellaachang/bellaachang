#### Hi 👋 I'm Bella! I am an aspiring **data scientist** who loves :bar_chart: *analysis of real-world problems*, :coffee: *coffee*, and 🧩 *jigsaw puzzles*. Nice to meet you! :D

- 💜🐻 I am about to begin my MS in Data Science at New York University through the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/). I completed my BA in [Data Science](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/academics/data-science-undergraduate-studies/data-science-major) with an emphasis in Cognition and a minor in [Public Policy](https://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/public-policy/) at the University of California, Berkeley.
- 🌱 I see data as a powerful tool which can help to explain complex problems and bolster communities and people. I hope to continue advancing this understanding throughout my career.
- ⚡️ My coursework has led me to understand that data has the power to make an impact in any field. I am particularly interested in using AI-powered techniques to understand human thinking and behavior, as well as make equal-access technology! I am also passionate about education in CS/DS, especially for younger people, which has led to my experiences as a tutor and TA for various courses at Berkeley, as well as a summer course instructor at the UW Robinson Center for 7th-10th graders breaking into the tech field.
- 👩🏻‍💻 I'm very comfortable with Python and SQL, and data analytics/visualization skills, as well as the softwares Jupyter and Git. I'm very familiar with Python libraries for data science, including (but not limited to) Pandas, Seaborn, matplotlib, and Plotly, as well as ML libraries like sk-learn, NumPy, scipy, and PyTorch. I also have a bit of experience with NLP libraries like NLTK, BERTopic, and SpaCy. On the data engineering side, I have some familiarity with Snowflake and MongoDB. Besides technical skills, I am confident conceptually in my statistical reasoning skills and critical thinking. I am also very organized, dedicated to details, a fast learner, and an enthusiastic team player. 
- ☁️ Outside of school, I love to run (recently ran the San Francisco Golden Gate Half Marathon)! & bake (my best creation has been a homemade raspberry soufflé). I love to read too; currently going through "An Anthropocene Reviewed" by John Green.
- 📫 Please feel free to email me at ic2664@nyu.edu with any questions.

Hope you have a lovely day!
