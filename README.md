#### Hi 👋 I'm Bella! I am an aspiring **data scientist** who loves :bar_chart: *analysis of real-world problems*, :coffee: *coffee*, and 🧩 *jigsaw puzzles*. Nice to meet you! :D

- 🐻 I am currently studying Data Science with an emphasis in Cognition and a minor in Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley.
- 🌱 I see data as a powerful tool which can help to EXPLAIN COMPLEX PROBLEMS and BOLSTER COMMUNITIES, and I hope to develop a better understanding of this throughout my career.
- ⚡️ My coursework has led me to understand that data has the power to make an impact in any field. I am particularly interested in probabilistic decision-making and supervised models!
- 💬 I love to read and write - about data science and beyond! You can see some of my articles on current data science news/topics within my data science organization's Medium https://medium.com/@dssberkeley.
- 📫 Please feel free to email me at bellachang@berkeley.edu with any questions.

💖 Hope you have a lovely day!
