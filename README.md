#### Hi 👋 I'm Bella!

- 🤓 I am about to begin my MS in Data Science at New York University through the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/). I completed my BA in [Data Science](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/academics/data-science-undergraduate-studies/data-science-major) with an emphasis in Cognition and a minor in [Public Policy](https://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/public-policy/) at the University of California, Berkeley.
- ⚡️ My coursework has shown me the transformative potential of data across disciplines to bolster people and communities, which is what drives my career aspirations. I have two primary interests within data science: on a micro-level, I hope to leverage models to understand human cognition and behavior, while on a macro level, I hope to create more equal-access technology. I also have a passion for CS and DS education as I hope to empower younger and wider ranges of students to enter the tech field.
- ☁️ Outside of school, I love to run (recently ran the San Francisco Golden Gate Half Marathon)! & bake (my best creation has been a homemade raspberry soufflé). I love to read too; currently going through "An Anthropocene Reviewed" by John Green.

#### 📫 Please feel free to email me at ic2664@nyu.edu with any questions. Hope you have a lovely day!
