#### Hi 👋 I'm Bella! I am an aspiring **data scientist** who loves :bar_chart: *analysis of real-world problems*, :coffee: *coffee*, and 🧩 *jigsaw puzzles*. Nice to meet you! :D

- 💜🐻 I am about to begin my MS in Data Science at New York University through the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/). I completed my Bachelor's in Data Science with an emphasis in Cognition and a minor in Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley.
- 🌱 I see data as a powerful tool which can help to explain complex problems and bolster communities and people. I hope to continue advancing this understanding throughout my career.
- ⚡️ My coursework has led me to understand that data has the power to make an impact in any field. I am particularly interested in using AI-powered techniques to understand human thinking and behavior, as well as make equal-access education! I am also passionate about education in CS/DS, especially for younger people, which has led to my vast experiences as tutors and TAs at Berkeley, as well as a summer course instructor at the UW Robinson Center for 7th-10th graders breaking into the tech field.
- ☁️ Outside of school, I love to run (recently ran the San Francisco Golden Gate Half Marathon)! & bake (my best creation has been a homemade raspberry soufflé). I love to read too; currently going through "An Anthropocene Reviewed" by John Green.
- 📫 Please feel free to email me at ic2664@nyu.edu with any questions.

💖 Hope you have a lovely day!
