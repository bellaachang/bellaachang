#### Hi 👋 I'm Bella! I am an aspiring **data scientist** who loves :bar_chart: *analysis of real-world problems*, :coffee: *coffee*, and 🧩 *jigsaw puzzles*. Nice to meet you! :D

- 💜🐻 I am about to begin my MS in Data Science at New York University through the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/). I completed my BA in [Data Science](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/academics/data-science-undergraduate-studies/data-science-major) with an emphasis in Cognition and a minor in [Public Policy](https://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/public-policy/) at the University of California, Berkeley.
- 🌱 I see data as a powerful tool which can help to explain complex problems and bolster communities and people. I hope to continue advancing this understanding throughout my career.
- ⚡️ My coursework has shown me the transformative potential of data across disciplines. I'm focused on leveraging AI to study human cognition and behavior, and advocating for equitable access to technology. I also have a passion for CS and DS education as I hope to empower younger and wider ranges of students to enter the tech field.
- 👩🏻‍💻 I excel in Python (including Pandas, Seaborn, matplotlib, Plotly), Java, and SQL, focusing on data analytics and visualization with Jupyter and Git. My expertise extends to machine learning frameworks like scikit-learn, NumPy, scipy, and PyTorch. I've applied NLP libraries such as NLTK, BERTopic, and SpaCy, and have hands-on experience in data engineering with Snowflake and MongoDB. I bring strong statistical reasoning, critical thinking, and thrive in collaborative environments, known for being highly organized, detail-oriented, and a quick learner.
- ☁️ Outside of school, I love to run (recently ran the San Francisco Golden Gate Half Marathon)! & bake (my best creation has been a homemade raspberry soufflé). I love to read too; currently going through "An Anthropocene Reviewed" by John Green.
- 📫 Please feel free to email me at ic2664@nyu.edu with any questions.

Hope you have a lovely day!
