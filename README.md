#### Hi 👋 I'm Bella! I am an aspiring **data scientist** who loves :bar_chart: *analysis of real-world problems*, :coffee: *coffee*, and 🧩 *jigsaw puzzles*. Nice to meet you! :D

- 💜🐻 I am about to begin my MS in Data Science at New York University through the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/). I completed my BA in [Data Science](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/academics/data-science-undergraduate-studies/data-science-major) with an emphasis in Cognition and a minor in [Public Policy](https://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/public-policy/) at the University of California, Berkeley.
- 🌱 I see data as a powerful tool which can help to explain complex problems and bolster communities and people. I hope to continue advancing this understanding throughout my career.
- ⚡️ My coursework has shown me the transformative potential of data across disciplines. I'm focused on leveraging AI to study human cognition and behavior, and advocating for equitable access to technology. I'm also deeply committed to teaching computer science and data science, evidenced by my roles as a tutor and TA at Berkeley, and as a summer course instructor at the UW Robinson Center, empowering younger students to enter the tech industry.
- 👩🏻‍💻 I'm proficient in Python and SQL, specializing in data analytics and visualization using tools like Jupyter and Git. My expertise includes Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, matplotlib, and Plotly for data science, along with machine learning frameworks like scikit-learn, NumPy, scipy, and PyTorch. I've also worked with NLP libraries including NLTK, BERTopic, and SpaCy. In data engineering, I have experience with Snowflake and MongoDB. Beyond technical skills, I excel in statistical reasoning and critical thinking. I'm highly organized, detail-oriented, a quick learner, and thrive in collaborative team environments.
- ☁️ Outside of school, I love to run (recently ran the San Francisco Golden Gate Half Marathon)! & bake (my best creation has been a homemade raspberry soufflé). I love to read too; currently going through "An Anthropocene Reviewed" by John Green.
- 📫 Please feel free to email me at ic2664@nyu.edu with any questions.

Hope you have a lovely day!
